Created a console application in .NET to fetch postcode data from a CSV file provided by My Society. The data is
imported into a PostgreSQL database, which was chosen due to its compatibility with the .NET ecosystem.
Additionally, Developed an API using .NET to interact with the postcode data.

Task 1: Console Application: - Created a console application in .NET core Version 6 to handle fetching postcode data
from a CSV file. The Link is provided for the project.

Task 2: Fetch Postcode Data: - Utilized the console application to read the postcode data from the provided CSV file.

Task 3: Database Choice:- Choose PostgreSQL as the database for storing the postcode data due to its compatibility
with the .NET ecosystem and its robust features.

Task 4: Import Data into Database:- Implemented functionality within the console application to import the postcode
data into the PostgreSQL database.

Task 5: API Development: - Developed an API using .NET to interact with the postcode data.Implemented controller
actions to Return postcodes with partial-string matches as JSON. Return postcodes near a specified location using
latitude and longitude coordinates. The link below is for the project.

Task 6: Unit Testing:- Implemented unit tests to validate data integrity and functionality of the system, ensuring that
the API endpoints return the expected results and handle various scenarios appropriately. Overall, this solution
provides a comprehensive approach to fetching postcode data from a CSV file, storing it in a PostgreSQL database, and
exposing it through an API for easy access and interaction. Additionally, the inclusion of unit tests ensures the
reliability and correctness of the system.
