Certainly! Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the project in a narrative format:

First, I created a console application using .NET Core version 6. This console application was designed to handle fetching postcode data from a CSV file. The project structure was set up to include necessary folders and files for efficiently handling CSV data.

Next, I focused on fetching the postcode data. Within the console application, I added a method to read the CSV file, utilizing libraries like `CsvHelper` to parse the data. Error handling mechanisms were implemented to manage potential issues such as missing or malformed data, ensuring the robustness of the data fetching process.

Choosing PostgreSQL as the database was the next step due to its compatibility with the .NET ecosystem and its robust features. I set up a PostgreSQL database instance and created the necessary database schema to store the postcode data, including fields for postcodes, latitude, longitude, and other relevant information.

The console application was then extended to include functionality for importing the postcode data into the PostgreSQL database. I implemented a method to establish a connection to the database and used an ORM like `Entity Framework Core` to map the CSV data to database entities. This allowed for efficient insertion of the parsed data into the database while ensuring data integrity and handling potential duplicates.

After setting up the database, I developed an API using .NET to interact with the postcode data. A new .NET project was created for the API, utilizing ASP.NET Core. Within this project, I defined models to represent the postcode data and implemented controllers with actions to return postcodes matching partial strings and to return postcodes near specified locations using latitude and longitude coordinates. Dependency injection was used to manage services and repository patterns for data access, promoting clean and maintainable code.

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the system, I implemented unit tests. A testing project was set up within the solution, and unit tests were written using a testing framework like `xUnit`. These tests validated the data integrity during the CSV import process, ensured the functionality of API endpoints, and handled various scenarios such as no matches found or invalid input. Running these tests and debugging as necessary ensured that all tests passed successfully.

In addition to these main tasks, I ensured proper logging within both the console application and the API for easier debugging and monitoring. Considerations for authentication and authorization were also made to enhance the security of the API. Documentation of the API endpoints was provided to facilitate easier consumption by other developers or services. Finally, deployment to a cloud service like Azure or AWS was considered for scalability and reliability, completing a comprehensive approach to fetching, storing, and interacting with postcode data.
